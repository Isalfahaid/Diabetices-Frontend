      <h2>Type 2 diabetes</h2>
      <p>
        Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body becomes resistant to
        the normal effects of insulin and gradually loses the capacity to
        produce enough insulin in the pancreas. The condition has strong genetic
        and family-related (non-modifiable) risk factors and is also often
        associated with modifiable lifestyle risk factors. We do not know the
        exact genetic causes of type 2 diabetes. People may be able to
        significantly slow or even halt the progression of the condition through
        changes to diet and increasing the amount of physical activity they do.
      </p>

      <h3>Type 2 diabetes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Is diagnosed when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin
          (reduced insulin production) and/or the insulin does not work
          effectively and/or the cells of the body do not respond to insulin
          effectively (known as insulin resistance)
        </li>
        <li>Represents 85–90 percent of all cases of diabetes</li>
        <li>
          Usually develops in adults over the age of 45 years but is
          increasingly occurring in younger age groups including children,
          adolescents, and young adults
        </li>
        <li>
          Is more likely in people with a family history of type 2 diabetes or
          from particular ethnic backgrounds
        </li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          For some, the first sign may be a complication of diabetes such as a
          heart attack, vision problems or a foot ulcer
        </li>
        <li>
          Is managed with a combination of regular physical activity, healthy
          eating, and weight reduction. As type 2 diabetes can be progressive,
          many people will need oral medications and/or insulin injections in
          addition to lifestyle changes over time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What happens with type 2 diabetes?</h3>

      <p>
        Type 2 diabetes develops over a long period of time (years). During this
        period of time insulin resistance starts, this is where the insulin is
        increasingly ineffective at managing the blood glucose levels. As a
        result of this insulin resistance, the pancreas responds by producing
        greater and greater amounts of insulin, to try and achieve some degree
        of management of the blood glucose levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        As insulin overproduction occurs over a very long period of time, the
        insulin-producing cells in the pancreas wear themselves out, so that by
        the time someone is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, they have lost 50 –
        70% of their insulin-producing cells. This means type 2 diabetes is a
        combination of ineffective insulin and not enough insulin. Lifestyle
        changes may be able to slow this process in some people.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, type 2 diabetes can often be managed with healthy eating and
        regular physical activity. Over time many people with type 2 diabetes
        will also need tablets and some may eventually require insulin. It is
        important to note that this is normal, and taking tablets or insulin as
        soon as they are required can result in fewer long-term complications.
      </p>

      <h3>What causes type 2 diabetes?</h3>

      <p>
        Diabetes runs in the family. If you have a family member with diabetes,
        you have a genetic disposition to the condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        While people may have a strong genetic disposition towards type 2
        diabetes, the risk is greatly increased if people display a number of
        modifiable lifestyle factors including high blood pressure, overweight
        or obesity, insufficient physical activity, poor diet and the classic
        ‘apple shape’ body where extra weight is carried around the waist.
      </p>

      <h3>People are at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes if they:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>have a family history of diabetes</li>
        <li>
          are older (over 55 years of age ) – the risk increases as we age
        </li>
        <li>are over 45 years of age and are overweight</li>
        <li>are over 45 years of age and have high blood pressure</li>
        <li>
          are over 35 years of age and are from an Aboriginal or Torres Strait
          Islander background
        </li>
        <li>
          are over 35 years of age and are from Pacific Island, Indian
          subcontinent or Chinese cultural background
        </li>
        <li>
          are a woman who has given birth to a child over 4.5 kgs (9 lbs), or
          had gestational diabetes when pregnant, or had a condition known as
          Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Symptoms</h1>
      <p>
        Many people with type 2 diabetes display no symptoms. As type 2 diabetes
        is commonly (but not always) diagnosed at a later age, sometimes signs
        are dismissed as a part of ‘getting older’. In some cases, by the time
        type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the complications of diabetes may already
        be present.
      </p>

      <h3>Symptoms include:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Being excessively thirsty</li>
        <li>Passing more urine</li>
        <li>Feeling tired and lethargic</li>
        <li>Always feeling hungry</li>
        <li>Having cuts that heal slowly</li>
        <li>Itching, skin infections</li>
        <li>Blurred vision</li>
        <li>Gradually putting on weight</li>
        <li>Mood swings</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Feeling dizzy</li>
        <li>Leg cramps</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Managing Type 2 Diabetes</h2>

      <p>
        While there is currently no cure for type 2 diabetes, the condition can
        be managed through lifestyle modifications and medication. Effectively
        managing diabetes is the best way to prevent diabetes-related
        complications. If you have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
        or have a family member with type 2 diabetes, view information on
        managing type 2 diabetes.

      <h3>Diabetes remission</h3>

      <p>
        Research shows that it is possible for some people with type 2 diabetes
        to achieve type 2 diabetes remission.
      </p>
      <p>
        We define type 2 diabetes remission as an HbA1c of under 6.5%
        (48mmol/mol) for at least three months without the need for
        glucose-lowering medications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common ways people have achieved remission is by achieving
        weight loss following very intensive dietary changes or through
        bariatric surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remission is not achievable for everyone with type 2 diabetes. In all
        studies of intensive dietary modifications, less than half of
        participants were able to achieve remission after one year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remission does not mean type 2 diabetes is cured or reversed – it simply
        means that people have blood glucose levels below the type 2 diabetes
        levels. It is important that people in remission continue to access
        regular diabetes monitoring at least annually and keep up their Annual
        Cycle of Care health care checks. Ongoing monitoring is required because
        glucose levels may increase again in people who are in remission and
        complications can develop
      </p>
      <p>
        People with type 2 diabetes who want to attempt diabetes remission need
        to do so in close consultation with their diabetes healthcare team, as
        intensive dietary and weight changes need careful management, monitoring
        and support.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who do not achieve or sustain remission should not feel that they
        have ‘failed’. The health benefits of weight loss and a reduction in
        HbA1c are significant even if remission does not occur, as these reduce
        the risk of developing diabetes-related complications and may lead to
        reducing or stopping glucose-lowering medications.
